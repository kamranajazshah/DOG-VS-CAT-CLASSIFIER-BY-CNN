# Cat vs Dog Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates the use of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images, and the goal is to classify whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

## Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification: distinguishing between cats and dogs. The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, and the CNN architecture is designed to learn hierarchical features in the images to make predictions.

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset of images.
2. **Model Building**: Designing the CNN architecture.
3. **Model Training**: Training the CNN on the dataset using backpropagation and optimization algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model’s performance on unseen images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the popular **Kaggle Dogs vs Cats** dataset, which consists of 25,000 labeled images (12,500 cats and 12,500 dogs). These images are stored in a directory structure where images are separated into 'cats' and 'dogs' folders.

### Dataset Details:
- **Input**: RGB images of cats and dogs.
- **Output**: Label of the image (`0` for cats and `1` for dogs).
- The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set (typically 80% training, 20% validation).

The images are resized to a consistent shape (e.g., 256x256 pixels) before being fed into the model.

## Model Architecture

This model uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with the following architecture:

1. **Conv2D Layers**: Multiple convolutional layers to extract features from images.
2. **MaxPooling2D Layers**: To downsample the feature maps.
3. **Flatten Layer**: To convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector for the fully connected layers.
4. **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.
5. **Dropout**: Applied to reduce overfitting.
6. **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to predict the binary output (cat or dog).

### Architecture Summary:
- Input Shape: `(256, 256, 3)` (for RGB images of size 256x256 pixels).
- Conv2D filters with ReLU activation.
- MaxPooling for dimensionality reduction.
- Flatten layer to transition to dense layers.
- Dense layer with 512 neurons.
- Output layer with a sigmoid activation function to classify images as cat or dog.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements:
To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `keras` (for building and training the CNN)
- `opencv-python` or `PIL` (for image preprocessing)
- `scikit-learn` (for metrics like accuracy)

## Training the Model

1. **Preprocessing the Data**:
   - Resize images to a fixed size (e.g., 256x256 pixels).
   - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
   - Perform data augmentation to prevent overfitting (e.g., random rotations, flips, etc.).

2. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Use the training set to train the model, while using the validation set for tuning hyperparameters.
   - Save the trained model after completion
   The training script will save the trained model as `model.h5`.
